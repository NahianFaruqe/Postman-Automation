# Explanation of the framework execution
# ---------------------------------------

Well, there are mainly 3 component of this automation framework
1- Config
2- Collector
3- Utilities
and eventually, all three are controlled and used by runner.py

Now, the "Config" part is where we keep all the configuration related to
the framework options and the collections/env/data options.
that is why, this "Config" is also categorised in two parts:
- core config => framework related config options
- api config  => api related config options for newman execution

And this "Collector" part is where all information of the "config"
got utilised and bundled to process further. So basically this
collector will talk to config and take all the required information,
and it will pass back to the runner; because ultimately it is the runner
who is going to consume it through utility;

For the "Utilities" component, it contains all the core functionality
including creating the system process for some command that the runner
will be passing to it.


And,
in the last but not the least the "Runner" file (a python script),
who is triggering everything;
and this runner will be executed by some entity like: human, jenkins, etc.


#-[Jenkins Setup Explanation]--------------------------------------
For the jenkins, we need to setup few things:
- Job type: Freestyle
- Build action: Which include following thing
    - [If any] Cleaning the old report
    - Pulling the new code
    - Running the framework
    - Copying the generated reports [html, junit xml]
- Post Build action: which include following thing
    - Publish the HTML report to the Jenkins
    - Integrate the JUnit xml report for jenkins graph (that you see for the job)
